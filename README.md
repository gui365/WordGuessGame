# Soccer Hangman

This project was the homework for week 3 of the Penn Coding Boot Camp.

## Goal
To create a word guessing game using JavaScript. When the page loads, a random word is picked and "hidden", and a message prompts the user to choose a letter by pressing a key. The user starts the game with 10 lives. If the letter is part of the hidden word, it is shown in any position/s where it appears in the hidden word. If it is not part of the word, the letter is added to the "guessed letters" section and the user loses a life. The process is repeated until either of the following scenarios plays:
  * All the letters of the word are guessed correctly. The user gets a win and the game restarts.
  * The user runs out of lives. The win counter is reset to 0 and the game restarts.

## Objective
To learn string and array methods (JavaScript).
